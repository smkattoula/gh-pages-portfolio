    <h1>More About Me</h1>
    <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
    <p>Besides coding? <span role="img" aria-label="wink emoji">ðŸ˜‰</span> <br/><br/>I also love creating music, meditating, running, hiking, rock-climbing, and skydiving.</p>
    <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
    <p>My dream job is to be able to get paid to be a creative problem-solver!</p>
    <h2>Where do you live?</h2>
    <p>I currently live in Oceanside, San Diego, CA.</p>
    <h2>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h2>
    <p>My passion for building web applications not only quenches my need to be creative, but it also challenges me to come up with creative solutions to every day problems. Every challenge in software development is an opportunity to learn, grow, and provide real value for myself and others. For me, coding is like climbing a mountain. The start of every project at first glance is like staring at a mountain top from the base and feeling excited for the climb. I start by breaking down this huge task into small, actionable steps. Then, I get to work one step at a time while facing inevitable obstacles along the way and making the resolve to find a solution to those obstacles. Finally, after a challenging but rewarding struggle, I reach the top of the mountain and feel an amazing sense of accomplishment. The best part is knowing that there is always another "mountain" out there to climb and that means another opportunity to hone my skills as a creative problem-solver.</p>
